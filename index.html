								<h3><a href="">Expression Recognition in Cohn Kanade+ dataset</a></h3>
							</header>
							<p>
								Trained a multi class support vector machine to recognise six facial expressions happy, surprise, sad, angry, disgust, fear by extracting features around the mouth and eyes regions of face.
Used a pyramid of local binary patterns on the low resolution images of Cohn Kanade+ dataset achieving 70% accuracy(highest) for happy and sad expressions.

							<h2>About Me</h2>
							<p> Here is the updated about me for your personal website:

A seasoned Data Scientist and Senior Data Engineer, my expertise spans business analysis, cloud backend engineering, machine learning, and deep learning. With a proven track record of cost-saving measures and successful project leadership, I leverage data science and cloud computing to drive innovation and efficiency in the tech industry.

Currently, I serve as a Senior Data Engineer at LeanTaaS, where I've designed and implemented a real-time data pipeline for hospital bed capacity management. My leadership in the data pipeline team following the departure of key members has helped streamline onboarding and maintain operational efficiency. Under my supervision, the company has achieved a significant expansion, leading to USD 1.5 million in annual recurring revenue. 

Prior to LeanTaaS, I worked as a Data Analyst at Pure Storage. There, my automation recommendations for cloud resources resulted in half a million USD in annual savings. My journey into data science was further enriched during my stint as a Data Science Intern at Checkpoint Software Technologies. I improved cloud serverless entities' cybersecurity using machine learning techniques and significantly reduced false positives in unsupervised anomaly detection models. 

My experience at Honeywell Technology Solutions allowed me to flex my leadership muscles as a Tech Lead. My projects included reducing the purchase cost of licenses, designing a proprietary software chatbot, and creating applications to lower the cost of legacy billing systems. As a Senior Engineer, I optimized cockpit information display and enhanced the flight crew alerting system using a machine learning approach.

My academic background includes a Masters in Data Science from the University of San Francisco, where I served as a Teaching Assistant for Machine and Deep Learning, and a B.Tech. in Electrical Engineering from IIT Hyderabad. I had a significant breakthrough in applying machine learning for a noble cause by collaborating with Ophthalmologists to automate Cataract diagnosis, which was published in the European Journal of Ophthalmology. 

My technical proficiencies include Python, SQL, JavaScript, and an array of Python Libraries like Scikit-Learn, NumPy, Pandas, PyTorch, PySpark, Plotly, Seaborn, Django. In cloud computing, I have worked extensively with AWS, GCP, Airflow, Git, Jenkins, and GraphQL.
</p>

						<p>
							I have always been fascinated with the idea of problem-solving and automation. Data Science is one of the ways to achieve it and I am loving it! 
							When I don't play with data, I like to gym and read science fiction and thriller based novels. Also, as I have already covered Zion and Big Bend, I look forward to visiting all the National Parks in the US.
